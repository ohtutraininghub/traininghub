# Zod
This project utilizes the [Zod](https://zod.dev/) library.     

Zod is a schema declaration and validation library that integrates with TypeScript. 
It is used to define and validate the shape of data, such as the data received from an API, user input, or data that is to be stored in a database. 
It ensures that the data is in the correct format and makes the code safer and easier to work with.
